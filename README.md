# shitgibbon-recipe-vault
The official recipe repository for the shitgibbons. It is based off a theme by 
[deranjer](https://github.com/deranjer/hugo-cookbook).

# Requirements
Install a recent version of [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and you are pretty much ready to roll
# Build

From the project's root directory, run
```
hugo server -D
```

This will watch all files in the project and rebuild as you change things. You can view the resulting
site [here](http://localhost:1313/)
