Aubergine linguini

1/2 onion chopped finely
1 tsp chilli flakes
6-10 anchovy fillets (to taste)
2 tbsp olive oil
2-3 tbsp butter
1 large aubergine cut into 1cm cubes
3 cloves garlic finely chopped
2 tbsp capers
2 ripe medium tomatoes
1 tbsp tomato paste
2 tsp brown sugar

Saute the onions, chilli and the anchovies in the oil until they are soft and 
translucent. The anchovies should dissolve completely in the process. Add the 
butter, garlic and aubergine and fry over a low heat stirring occasionally 
until the aubergine is soft (10 mins). Add the capers, tomatoes, tomato paste 
and brown sugar. Simmer for another 5 to 10 minutes. Serve in bowls on top of 
some steaming linguini.

Notes: Add more butter if the aubergine absorbs it. Butter is good.
