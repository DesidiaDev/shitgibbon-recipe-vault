60ml cooking oil
2kg good quality lamb knuckles or leg cut into 4cmx4cm pieces
4 large yellow onions halved and cut into thin slices
10 cloves of garlic finely crushed
250ml dry white wine
500ml double cream Greek style yoghurt
4 5cm sprigs of fresh rosemary
handful of coarsely chopped dill
salt 

If you plan to use the oven to cook the dish, pre-heat it to 180C. Heat the oil in a 
large oven proof casserole/dutch oven/potjie and brown the meat pieces in batches in  
until they pick up good colour. Put the meat in a dish and set aside. Add the onions 
to the pot (add a little more oil if needed), frying them until they just start to 
brown. Add the garlic and stir for 30 seconds then add the wine to de-glaze the pot. 
Allow a little of the wine to cook off then add the remaining ingredients, seasoning
as desired with the salt and the pepper. Stir and bring the mixture to a slow boil. 
If you are using an oven, place the dish in the oven and bake for 1h30m. Alternatively, 
cook very slowly on the stove or open fire for 1h30m. When cooked, the meat should still
be holding its shape but be very soft and tender. Serve with flat breads or rice and
a leafy green salad.

It works very well in a round bottomed "potjie" and prepared over an open fire.
