DESCRIPTION
The original recipe adapted from ‘Food of Portugal’ calls for seeding the tomatoes before 
cooking. I use a technique of grating tomato halves which gives a great pulp with no
skins at all. The result is a fragrant, hearty dish. The liquid to rice ratio is the 
only important part of the recipe. Feel free to mess around with the other ingredients.

INGREDIENTS
4 tablespoons olive, sunflower or canola oil
1 cup diced onion
2-4 cloves garlic minced
2 tsp chilli flakes (if desired)
6 medium fresh tomatoes (to make 2 cups of pulp)
2 tablespoons tomato paste
1 tablespoon brown sugar
1 1/2 cups vegetable stock
1 cup long-grain white rice
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper

INSTRUCTIONS
Slice the tomatoes in half and grate them flesh side first until just the skins are 
left to obtain 2 cups of pulp and juice. You can also put them into a blender.

In a medium pot with a tight-fitting lid, heat the oil over medium to high heat.
Add onions and cook for 2 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for 1-2 mins, being careful
not to burn it. 

Add the tomato pulp, the tomato paste and the sugar, cover and simmer for 30 minutes,
stirring occasionally. Add stock, bring to a boil and add rice, salt and pepper.
Cover and after it comes to a boil, lower to a gentle simmer and cook 20 minutes covered.
Remove from heat and fluff with fork before serving.

NOTES
The recipe works well with brown rice. Just cook the rice for 40mins instead of 20 mins.
You can also add 2 cans of black beans or steamed garden peas to make a complete meal. 
I drain and rinse the beans then sprinkle them over the top of the rice to warm through. 
Stir them in when you fluff the rice. Garnish with coriander leaves. 

Serves 4. 6 if beans are added.
