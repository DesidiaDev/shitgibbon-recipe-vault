Peppered Chicken with Cream

1 generous tablespoon butter
2 slugs olive oil
1 tablespoon black peppercorns crushed
1 brown onion finely chopped
50ml brandy
4 chicken breasts sliced into 1.5cm slices
200ml chicken stock
100ml cream
1 heaped teaspoon green peppercorns

Melt the butter and add the oil to a medium pot. As the butter melts, add the crushed peppercorns and continue heating until the butter just starts to turn colour. Add the brandy. Light it! You know you love a good flambé. Once the flames subside, turn off the fire alarm and toss in the onions. Sauté the onions until they soften and turn translucent with a hint of brown. Add the chicken to the pot and brown it, turning every minute or two until it just changes colour. Add the chicken stock and bring to the boil. Add the cream and the green peppercorns. Simmer for 15-20 minutes, turning up the heat towards the end to reduce the sauce to a thick peppery goodness. Serve with fries or mash and a side of steamed greens to take the edge off the pepper.
