Gochujang dipping sauce

1/4 cup gochujang
1/4 cup sugar
3 Tablespoon strawberry jam - - use the seedless variety
2 1/2 Tablespoon soy sauce
1 1/2 Tablespoon rice wine vinegar
1 Tablespoon honey
6 Tablespoon water
2 cloves garlic - - minced
1/2 teaspoon ginger - - grated
1/2 teaspoon salt

Put all the ingredients into a pot and bring it to the boil and let it thicken (2.3 minutes). Check
that it is thick enough by dipping it on a cold plate and checking its consistency. If it is too thick, add a little water. Caution, it burns easily.

Note that the sauce gets quite dark from all the soy sauce so ease up on that if you want a
redder sauce.
