Simple cabbage, lentil and potato stew

3 tbsp vegetable oil
1 large onion chopped
t tsp chilli flakes
4 large potatoes peeled and cut into 1cm cubes
2 tablespoons yeast extract
50ml rice or white wine vinegar
1 medium cabbage shredded
2 tins lentils drained and rinsed
100ml water
1 tsp salt

Fry the onions in the oil until they are translucent (5 mins). Add the potatoes and saut√© until the potatoes start to pick up some brown spots and starts to stick to the bottom of the pot (5-10min).
De-glaze the pot with the vinegar and add the salt and the cabbage. Turn the heat down and simmer
for 15 mins then add the lentils. Simmer until the potatoes start to soften. Add the water if necessary but don't let the liquid accumulate. 

Note that the acid in the vinegar will prolong the potato cooking time. Grab a spud cube and taste 
it because they may seem hard but they actually just have a firm texture. The vinegar adds a nice bite to the dish so it is worth cooking it a bit longer. As an alternative, parboil the potatoes first then brown them with the onions.
