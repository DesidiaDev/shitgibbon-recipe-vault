Spicy potato and chickpea soup

2 onions roughly chopped
4 cloves garlic crushed
4 large carrots peeled and cut into 5mm rounds
6 medium potatoes peeled and cut into 2cm squares
2 440g tins of chick peas with the juice
1 tablespoon coriander
2 tablespoons paprika
2 tablespoons tomato paste
2 cups vegetable stock
1 teaspoon salt
6 baby bok choy or 1/2 regular bok choy shredded
2 tablespoons sriracha sauce (optional)
Salt & pepper to taste

Sauté the onions until translucent then add the garlic and sauté for another minute.
Add the carrots and simmer on a very low heat for 5 minutes. Turn up the heat and 
add the potatoes, spices and tomato paste and sauce and stir for a minute or two. 
Add the chickpeas and stock (it should just cover the ingredients). Stir and simmer
for 30-40 minutes (the potatoes should be nice and soft). Stir in the bok choy and 
the sriracha and bring the mixture back to the boil. The bok choy should still be 
just wilted and the white parts should retain their texture. Check the seasoning and 
serve immediately.
