8-10 Kashmiri chilies, dried
1 tsp black mustard seed
1 tsp whole cumin
1/2 tsp turmeric
4 cloves
4 garlic cloves
1 piece ginger (about the 1/2 of a thumb size)
2 tbsp apple cider or white wine vinegar
1 tbsp cooking oil (something neutral)
2 tbsp water
For the Vindaloo, you need:

1 lb pork shoulder (beef chuck or lamb leg)
1 whole sweet onion
1 stick cinnamon
1 tbsp tomato paste
1 tbsp cooking oil
1 tsp brown sugar
1 cup water


Slightly toast the Kashmiri chilies, black mustard seed, cumin, and cloves in a pan, then place it inside of a food processor with the turmeric, garlic, ginger, vinegar, cooking oil and water. Blend the mixture until it turns into a thick paste.
Cut the meat into 2inch/5cm cubes, them mix them with the vindaloo paste we just made, cover the marinated meat and place them in the fridge for at least 4 hours, but 24 hours is ideal.
Chop the sweet onion, then place a deep pan over medium heat, add the oil and cook the onion with some salt and the cinnamon stick for 10 min. (I like to add 2 cloves of garlic to add some more garlic-ness)
Add the marinated meat with all the paste into the same pan, cook for about 10 to 15 min or until the surface of the meat is browned. Then add the tomato paste, brown sugar and water into the pan. Bring it to a simmer, cover the pan and cook for about 1 hour or until the meat is tender.
Serve the vindaloo with some warm fluffy rice. And Enjoy!
