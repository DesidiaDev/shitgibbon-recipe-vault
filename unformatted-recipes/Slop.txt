Slop

2 tablespoons cooking oil/butter
1 large onion sliced
1 clove of garlic finely chopped
2 tsp paprika
1/2 tsp chilli powder/hot sauce
500g boerewors cut into 4cm chunks
4 potatoes peeled and chopped into bite sized pieces
1 tin of crushed tomatoes
1 tablespoon of tomato paste (optional)
1 cup frozen peas (optional)
1 heaped teaspoon sugar

First of all, make sure you are not expecting guests. This is not for guests...
Fry onions until they start to turn in colour. Add the garlic and stir for 30 seconds.
Add the spices, stir for another 30 seconds then add the boerewors pieces. Stir well
then fry over a low heat until the boerewors discolours. Turn occasionally. Add the rest of the ingredients except the peas, stir and simmer for 30 minutes or until the potatoes are soft. If you are using peas, add them about 5 mins before the potatoes are done. Now
grab a beer, fire up a violent movie and enjoy the solitude.
