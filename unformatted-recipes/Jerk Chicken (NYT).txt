Ingredients
2  teaspoons coriander seeds
1 ½  teaspoons cumin seeds
1  cup soy sauce
1  cup extra-virgin olive oil
8  ounces Guinness stout
1  medium red onion (about 9 ounces), finely chopped
8  scallions, thinly sliced
¼  cup Tabasco sauce
1  large nutmeg seed, freshly grated (about 4 teaspoons)
¼  cup whole allspice berries, ground (about 3 tablespoons)
6  large garlic cloves, minced (about 3 tablespoons)
2  tablespoons fresh thyme leaves
1  tablespoon whole black peppercorns, crushed
1  tablespoon honey
1  tablespoon balsamic vinegar
2  teaspoons smoked paprika
1  teaspoon finely chopped fresh rosemary
1  teaspoon ground cinnamon
1  jalapeño, stemmed, seeded and finely chopped
2  habanero chiles, stemmed, seeded and finely chopped
3  dried bay leaves
12  boneless, skin-on chicken thighs
FOR THE PICKLED BANANAS:
6  cups white vinegar
1 ½  cups granulated sugar
4  branches fresh thyme
3  tablespoons kosher salt
2  garlic cloves, peeled and smashed
1  habanero chile, split, seeds and stem intact
6  cloves
6  just-ripe bananas

PREPARATION
In a small skillet, toast the coriander and cumin seeds over medium heat, shaking the pan, until fragrant, 2 minutes. Let cool, then grind in a spice grinder until pulverized.
Add to a large bowl along with all other marinade ingredients (everything but the chicken). Add 1 cup water and whisk to combine. Alternatively, working in two batches, place all marinade ingredients in the bowl of a food processor. Pulse 2 or 3 times to combine.
Place chicken in a large container big enough for all pieces plus marinade. Reserve 3/4 cup marinade for later use, and pour remaining marinade over the chicken. Refrigerate 1 or 2 days (chicken can be stored for up to 5 days).
Prepare the pickled bananas: Add all ingredients except for the bananas to a nonreactive saucepan and boil over high, 10 minutes. Chill completely. Once brine is chilled, peel and slice the bananas on the bias. Add to the brine and chill, at least 1 hour and up to 2 days.
Heat grill to medium-low. Remove chicken from marinade and temper at room temperature for 15 minutes. Place chicken on the grill, skin-side down. Every minute or so, rotate the chicken a half turn so that the skin develops a deep, dark mahogany char and has been slightly crisped and rendered, 8 to 10 minutes total.
Turn chicken over to finish cooking, 6 to 8 minutes. Transfer to a serving platter, skin side up. Brush the reserved marinade on the skin side. Remove bananas from brine and serve with jerk chicken.
