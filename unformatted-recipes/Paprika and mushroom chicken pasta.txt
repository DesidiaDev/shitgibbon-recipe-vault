400g filleted chicken thighs chopped into bite sized pieces
1 tablespoon light soy sauce
1 large knob of butter
1 clove of garlic finely chopped
400g chopped (quartered) portobellini mushrooms
Another large knob of butter
1 tablespoon sweet paprika
10 cherry tomatoes halved
1 cup chicken stock
100g (1 wheel/block) feta cheese
Salt and ground pepper

Sprinkle the soy sauce over the chicken pieces and season with salt and pepper.
Heat the butter in a pan and fry the chicken pieces. Turn the pieces infrequently
so they get well browned. When they are browned, add the garlic and toss for 30 
seconds before transferring to a bowl. Fry the mushrooms in more butter for 30 seconds.
Add the paprika and saut√© for a few minutes. Add the tomatoes, toss until they 
just start to soften. Add the stock and bring it to the boil. Add the chicken to 
the mixture and crumble the feta over the mixture. Simmer for 5 minutes so that
the feta cheese is completely melted. Adjust seasoning and serve over pasta.

If you are feeling indulgent, replace the stock with cream, being careful not to 
let the sauce get too thick. Cowards may leave out the feta cheese with this option.
