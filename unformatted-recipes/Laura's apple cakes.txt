Name in Spanish: Masitas de manzana (which translates directly to little apple cakes)

Ingredients:
Dough
Self raising flour 500g
sugar 220g
unsalted butter (softened) 200g
egg yolks 3
milk 4tb

Filling
apples 5 or 6, peeled and sliced
sugar 2tb
cinnamon 2tb

Others
icing sugar

Method
mix all ingredients for the dough until well combined (your can add a little extra milk if you want it softer). Divide in 2 parts and set aside covered to rest for about 30 min.
Butter and dust with flour a medium sized oven tray (metal or pyrex, no silicone)
Roll the dough and place on the tray
Cover with apple slices very (very close together) and sprinkle sugar and cinnamon.
Roll the other half of the dough and place it on the apples. Press the dough down with your hands so the 3 layers sit close together (avoid air pockets).
Bake at 180C for about 25min. 
Cool and sprinkle icing sugar on it and cut in small squares.

Notes:
Red apples will give a softer and sweeter texture to the cake
Granny Smith apples with be more crunchy and sour... It's up to you which apples you choose
I use organic unrefined sugar which gives a much better caramelized texture but this is not part of the original recipe

Let me know how it went (or much better: invite me to have some cake!!)

Ciao!
