American style pancake recipe (serves 4) 
Modified by Dave from one found at southernfood.about.com

    * 2 cups all-purpose flour (sifted)
    * 2 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
    * 3 tablespoons granulated sugar
    * 1/2 teaspoon salt
    * 2 large eggs
    * 1 1/2 to 1 3/4 cups milk
    * 2 tablespoons melted butter 

Preparation:
Sift together flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt. In a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs and 1 1/2 cups of milk; add to flour mixture, stirring only until smooth. Blend in melted butter. If the batter seems too thick to pour, add a little more milk. Cook on a hot, greased griddle, using about 1/4 cup of batter for each pancake. Cook until bubbly, a little dry around the edges, and lightly browned on the bottom; turn and brown the other side. Serve smothered in maple syrup and a monstruous blob of real butter. 

Add diced banana, blueberries, nuts and other things to the batter for some interesting alternatives.
