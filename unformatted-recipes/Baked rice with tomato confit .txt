1 3/4 lb (800 grams) cherry tomatoes
12 large garlic cloves or 25 small, peeled and cut in half if large
4 large shallots cut into 1 1/4 inch (3 cm) pieces
1 1/4 cups cilantro stems cut into 1 1/2 inch (4 cm) lengths. Save the leaves for garnishing
3 tbsp thyme leaves
4 small cinnamon sticks if large, break in half
7 tbsp (100 ml) olive oil
kosher salt and fresh cracked pepper
1 1/2 cups (300 grams) basmati rice
2 1/2 cups (600 ml) boiling water


Preheat the oven to 350F
Arrange the tomatoes, garlic, shallots, cilantro stems, thyme and cinnamon sticks in a large high sided casserole or baking dish. (it should be about 8x12 inches or 20 x 30 cm)
Pour in the olive oil, 1/2 tsp of salt and 1/2 tsp of pepper.
Place in the oven, uncovered, for 1 hour, till softened.
Remove from the oven and sprinkle the rice all over the vegetables, but do NOT stir them together. Set aside.
Increase the oven temperature to 450F
Sprinkle 3/4 tsp salt and 1/2 tsp of pepper over the rice.
Carefully pour the boiling water evenly over everything. Seal the dish tightly with tinfoil.
Bake in the oven for 25 minutes, until the rice is cooked.
Remove and set aside for 10 minutes. Do not remove the foil. The residual steam will finish the rice off perfectly.
Remove the foil, sprinkle with chopped cilantro leaves, stirring them gently into the rice.
Serve.
Recipe Notes
Recipe from Simple by Yotam Ottolenghi.

I state that this recipe will feed six as a side, or four as a main.  Even though it is just two of us at home, I make the entire dish, as it keeps well and reheats perfectly.  Trust me, you will want it all.  But if necessary, it is a recipe that can be easily cut in half.  But why??
