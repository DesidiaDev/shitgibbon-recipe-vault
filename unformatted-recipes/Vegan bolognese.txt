Vegan "bolognese"

1 large onion finely chopped
1 large carrot finely chopped
3 stalks of celery finely chopped
1 red bell pepper finely chopped
4 cloves of garlic also (surprise) finely chopped
Good slug of olive oil
3 tbsp nutritional yeast
1 tbsp smoked paprika
1 tbsp ground coriander
2 tbsp tomato concentrate
2 cups of textured vegetable protein mince
1 cup red wine
1 bay leaf
1 can chopped tomatoes or 4 medium whole tomatoes finely chopped
Vegetable stock as needed
Salt and pepper to taste


Cook the onion, carrot, celery and the pepper in the oil over a very slow heat for 15 mins. Add the garlic and cook for a further 5 minutes to end up with a fragrant soffrito. A good soffrito is not browned, merely fragrant with a translucent vibe. While the soffrito is cooking, cover the textured vegetable protein in boiling water and set aside to soak.

Add the yeast and spices and stir over a low heat to release the fragrance. Add the textured vegetable protein, tomato concentrate, wine, bay leaf and tomatoes. Add a little stock to so the liquid to just covers the mixture. Bring the mixture to a slow simmer, adjust the seasoning and simmer for a further 30-40 minutes.

Serve it over huge piles of steaming spaghetti (get the good stuff)
