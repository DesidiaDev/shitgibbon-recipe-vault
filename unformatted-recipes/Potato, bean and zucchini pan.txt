Potato, beans and zucchini pan

2 tbsp butter/canola oil
2 medium red onions sliced into rings
3 cloves garlic
1 tsp chilli flakes
4 medium potatoes sliced with skin on
1 handful of dill coarsely chopped
250ml vegetable stock
1 can (440g) cannellini beans drained.
salt
pepper
8 small zucchini's ends removed and sliced lengthwise into 3mm ribbons
Chipotle sauce
200g strong cheddar cheese grated
1 tbsp Zaatar
Smoked paprika

Saut√© the onions in the butter/oil in a heavy oven proof skillet until they start 
to soften (5min) then add the garlic and fry for a further 1 minute. Add the slices 
of potato, pushing the slices under the onion mix so the potato layers have onions 
between them. Sprinkle the dill over the mixture and pie over the stock. The stock
should just cover the mix with a few slices of potato sticking out. Spread the beans
over the mix, season generously with pepper and a little salt then cover loosely with 
a lid and simmer for 20-25 minutes until the potato has cooked and the bulk of the 
liquid has cooked off. 

In the mean time, pan fry the zucchini in a little oil until the strips are soft
and have picked up some brown bits. 

When the potato and bean mix has cooked through, spread the cooked zucchini in one
layer that covers all the potato mix. Spread a generous amount of the chipotle sauce
over the zucchini. Sprinkle the cheese in a thick layer then top with the zaatar and
a little smoked paprika. Pop the pan under the grill until the cheese starts to brown
and bubble. Serve with a fresh green salad.
