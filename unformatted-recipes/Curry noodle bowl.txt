Curry noodle bowl (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjeFO8I-68c)

2 tbsp vegetable oil
1 medium onion finely chopped
1 tsp salt

1 tsp tumeric
1 tsp coriander powder
1 tsp cumin powder
1/2 tsp chilli powder

2-3 ripe tomatoes
6 peeled cloves of garlic
3cm ginger piece, peeled and coarsely chopped

1 tin full fat coconut cream
2 cups water

300g firm tofu or alternatively 300g firm fleshed fish cut into 2cm cubes
400g vegetables (carrots/broccoli/snap peas etc) cut as appropriate.

Rind from one lime
2tbsp lime juice from the above lime
2 tbsp sesame oil
4-6 spring onions sliced (you are after the greens)

4 portions of asian noodles

Fry the onions with the salt in the oil at a medium to high heat until they just start to 
caramelise. While the onions are frying, put the tomato, ginger and garlic into a blender and
blend until completely liquidised.

Add the spices and stir for 20s then immediately add the tomato puree. Bring the mixture to 
a boil. Reduce the sauce until it is about half its volume. It will be quite thick and the 
oil will start to separate from the paste. Add the coconut and water and bring the mixture
to the boil. Simmer for 20 minutes. While the mixture is simmering, add the vegetables as
appropriate to their required cooking time. Add the tofu (if using) fairly early so it can 
absorb the flavours. The goal is to have all the vegetables cooked but are still crisp.

Finish the sauce by stirring in the lime rind, lime juice and sesame. Divide the noodles int 4
bowls and ladle the sauce over the noodles. Top with the spring onions.
