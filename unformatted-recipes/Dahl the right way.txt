Dahl the right way
From https://glebekitchen.com/tarka-dhal/

Ingredients

The dhal
1 cup masoor dahl
3 1/2 cups water plus more as needed
1/2 tsp turmeric
1 tsp salt

The tarka
3 tbsp oil vegetable or other neutral oil
1 onion finely diced
2 dried red chilies
1 tsp mustard seed
1 tsp cumin seed
4 green chilies de-seeded and chopped
10 or so fresh curry leaves
1 tsp dried methi – dried fenugreek leaves
1 tbsp tomato paste in 2 Tbsp water or some fresh tomato, diced
1 tbsp lemon juice – about 1/6 of a lemon
handful of cilantro chopped

Instructions

The dahl

Combine the masoor lentils, water and turmeric.
Bring to a lively simmer uncovered. Uncovered is key. I've had lentils boil over on me more times than I can count. Now I start them uncovered. Problem solved.
Once the lentils come to a simmer, reduce heat to low and cover.
Cook lentils until they completely break down into a creamy consistency. You will not be able to discern individual lentils. This should take somewhere around 40 minutes.
Add the salt. You will adjust the seasoning at the end.

The tarka

Heat the oil over medium heat.
Add the dried red chilies if using. Cook until the edged just start to bubble.
Flip the dried red chilies. Add the mustard seeds and cumin seed and fry briefly. They should crackle a bit and dance around.
Turn the heat down a bit and add onion. Cook until the onions are translucent.
Add the green chilies, curry leaves and methi and continue to cook for around 2 minutes.
Stir in the tomato paste or fresh tomatoes if using. Cook for 20-30 seconds then add the tarka to the dahl.
Stir to thoroughly combine.
Adjust consistency to your taste with little bit of water (I like it a bit runny).
Add the cilantro and lemon juice to taste.
Adjust salt. Around a half a tsp give or take. Creep up on it. You can add salt. You can't take it away.
Enjoy.
