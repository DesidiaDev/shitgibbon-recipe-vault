Typical Algerian Couscous 
From "The Cranks Bible" by Nadine Abensur
Annotated by Dave

The confusing thing here is this is a vegetable stew called couscous, served with other stuff called couscous. The second couscous comes in a box and is yellow. Just add water.

3 tbsp olive oil
500g leeks, trimmed and chopped into 2cm pieces
300g onion, finely chopped
4 cloves of garlic, sliced finely
Salt and fresh ground pepper
3 tbsp cumin (yes, tablespoons)
pinch of saffron in 3 tbsp hot water
500g carrots scraped and cut into 2cm chunks
500g courgettes, cut into 2cm pieces
400g can chickpeas, liquid included
400g whole tomatoes, liquid included
chopped parsley or coriander to garnish

Saute the leeks in a heavy pot until golden. Remove from the pot and set aside.

In the same pot, add the onions and fry over a medium heat until just starting to brown. Add the salt, garlic and cumin and fry for 3-4 minutes. Loosen with the saffron water if needed.

Add the carrots and saute until they start to soften. Then add the courgettes and saute for a few more minutes. The idea is that all the vegetables reach that tender but not soggy stage at the same time. Tricky timing.

Add the chickpeas, leeks, saffron water, raisins and tomatoes and simmer for 10 minutes or so to get the vegetables tender. Break up the tomatos a bit with a spoon as you stir. The sauce should not be too thick as you want to soak it up with the couscous.

Garnish with the herbs and serve with a chermoula or a fiery harissa sauce, a huge mound of fluffy couscous and a green salad. FYI, Nadine makes her couscous (grain) with a weak stock (1 marigold cube to 400g hot water), but a purist approach is fine here.

The rest is easy! Eat, drink and be merry.
