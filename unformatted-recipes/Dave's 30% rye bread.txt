Dave's 30% rye
This makes a tasty loaf with a very soft crumb and fine holes. The dough has a 65% hydration and is best kneaded with damp hands as it is a bit sticky.

Poolish:

150g rye flour
350g white bread flour
500g room temperature water
4g dried yeast


Final dough
150g rye flour
350g white bread flour
150g water
20g salt
6g dried yeast

Prepare the polish by mixing the ingredients until you get a smooth paste. Let the polish ferment for 6-8 hours at room temperature.

Once the fermentation is complete, dissolve the salt in the water and combine the water and the remaining ingredients with the poolish and knead until you get an elastic smooth (but sticky) dough (about 10 mins). Kneading is best done with wet hands and some cussing but it soon smoothes out into a manageable elastic dough. Put the dough into a bowl and let it rise for an hour (it must double it's size). Once it has risen, turn it out dry side down onto a lightly floured surface and divide into two 800g loaves. Stretch and shape each loaf and let them rest for a few minutes before putting them unto a well floured 800g oval banneton. Proove the loaves until the dough just reaches the top of the banneton. Turn them out and score lengthwise down the centre.

Bake for 15 minutes at 230°C using steam, then turn the heat down to 190°C bake for a further 25 minutes. Allow to cool completely on a wire rack.


You can cold ferment the bread by putting the bannetons into the fridge after proving. 12-18h does the job just fine and adds considerable flavour to the bread.
