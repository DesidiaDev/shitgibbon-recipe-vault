1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil

1 onion, finely chopped

Salt to taste

1 tablespoon sweet paprika

1 medium head green or red cabbage, finely shredded

1 14-ounce can chopped tomatoes with juice

2 teaspoons sugar

2 teaspoons red wine vinegar, cider vinegar or sherry vinegar

1/4 cup chopped fresh dill

2 cups water

1 cup coarse bulgur

1 15-ounce can chickpeas, drained and rinsed

1. Heat the olive oil over medium heat in a large, heavy lidded skillet
or Dutch oven. Add the onion, and cook, stirring often, until tender,
about five minutes. Stir in a pinch of salt and the paprika. Cook,
stirring, until the onion is thoroughly tender and infused with paprika,
three to four minutes.

2. Add the cabbage, and cook, stirring, for three minutes or until it
begins to wilt. Stir in the tomatoes, sugar and vinegar, and add salt to
taste. Bring to a simmer, lower the heat, cover and simmer 15 minutes
until the cabbage is thoroughly tender.

3. Stir in the dill and the water, and bring a to a boil. Add the bulgur
and chickpeas. Stir to combine. When the water comes back to a boil,
reduce the heat to low and cover. Simmer 10 minutes or until all of the
water has been absorbed. Remove from the heat, taste and adjust
seasonings, and serve hot or at room temperature.

Yield: Serves six.
