Shiitaki pasta


150g butter
1 large onion finely chopped
3 cloves garlic finely chopped
2 tablespoons wheat flour
250ml white wine
500ml milk
Big handful of fresh curly leafed parsley
300g Shiitake mushrooms
100ml cream
salt
ground pepper


Saut√® the onions and garlic in the butter over a very low heat until they are translucent (10 mins). While the
onions are softening, fry the mushrooms in a hot pan tossing frequently until they pick up some colour and 
soften. Add the flour and stir until it forms a roux. Let the roux develop for 5 mins or so then add the wine 
and stir. Bring this to the boil for a minute or two to remove some of the alcohol then slowly add the milk 
to get a think sauce. Add the fried mushrooms and simmer for a few minutes. Add the cream, salt and pepper to 
taste and stir. Serve over tagliatelle or spaghetti.
