Base recipe is https://www.shape.com/recipe/red-lentil-beet-soup


Ingredients
6 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
500g beets (about 6 medium), 4 cut into 1cm cubes, 2 julienne sliced 
1 small onion, finely chopped (1 cup)
5 garlic cloves, thinly sliced
Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper
1.5 teaspoons chilli flakes
Pinch of cinnamon
1.25l vegetable stock
1.5 cups red lentils
3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice, plus 1/2 tsp. finely grated lemon zest
A couple of handfuls of fresh herbs such as dill, parsley or coriander.

In a medium saucepan, heat 125ml cooking oil over medium-high. Add the cubed beets, onion, and garlic; season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring, until onion is soft, about 5 min. Add chilli flakes and cinnamon. Cook, stirring, until fragrant. Pour in the stock, and stir in the lentils. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer, partially covered, until lentils are tender, about 20 min. Stir in 1 Tbsp. lemon juice, and season with salt and pepper. You want the lentils to be just breaking up and the beets to have some texture. The soup should be quite thick.

Make the topping by mixing the julienned beet with the herbs, zest, olive oil and  half the lemon juice. Season with salt and pepper if needed.

Ladle the soup up into 4 bowls and top with the beet salad and serve.
