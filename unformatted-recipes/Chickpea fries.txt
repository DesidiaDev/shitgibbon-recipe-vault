INSTRUCTIONS
Bring 4 cups water to a boil in a large saucepan over high heat. Meanwhile, sift 2 cups chickpea flour into a medium bowl and whisk in 1 teaspoon kosher salt. Generously coat an 8- or 9-inch square or round baking pan with olive oil.
While whisking constantly, slowly pour the chickpea flour mixture into the boiling water. Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook (be careful, it may bubble and splatter!), whisking constantly and reducing the heat if needed, until the mixture looks like a glossy, sticky cake batter with some small lumps, about 20 minutes. Taste and season with more kosher salt as needed.
Pour the mixture into the baking dish and immediately smooth the top with an offset spatula. Let cool completely, about 90 minutes. (Alternatively, let cool on the counter for 15 minutes, lightly cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for 30 minutes to speed up the cooling process.)
When you are ready to fry, invert the baking dish onto a cutting board to remove the slab from the pan. Cut the slab in half. Cut each piece crosswise into 3/4-inch-thick pieces (you can also cut them thinner or thicker if desired).
Heat 1 1/2 cups olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat until 350ÂºF. Working in batches of 5 or 6, add the panisse to the oil and fry, flipping once, until golden-brown all over, about 2 1/2 minutes per side. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate. Sprinkle with kosher salt, flaky salt, or freshly ground black pepper. Enjoy with Sriracha mayo or harissa mayo, with a lemon wedge for squeezing, or your favorite dipping sauce.
