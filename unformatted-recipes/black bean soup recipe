Black bean soup
---------------

    * 6 cups cooked black beans (reserve cooking liquid if homemade)
    * 2 bay leaves
    * 3 tablespoons olive oil
    * 1 white onion, diced
    * 1 yellow bell pepper, diced
    * 4 cloves garlic, minced
    * 1 tablespoon dried oregano
    * 1 teaspoon dried cumin
    * 1 teaspoon or more smoked paprika (optional, adds a bit of smokiness without much heat)
    * 6 mandarin oranges (or fewer, larger oranges)
    * 1/4 cup red onion, finely diced
    * 1 (or more) jalapeno pepper, thinly sliced
    * 1 handful cilantro leaves
    * salt to taste
    * Mexican crema or sour cream

   1. Heat the beans and bay leaves in a soup-sized pot, with not quite enough liquid to cover. If you boiled them at home and have the reserved cooking liquid, use that. If not, just use water and optionally add a little vegetable broth powder. Bring to a simmer.
   2. In a skillet, heat the olive oil over medium high heat. Add the onion, bell pepper, and garlic and a big pinch of salt, and saute for 5 minutes until starting to brown. Add the oregano, cumin and smoked paprika and cook for 1 more minute. Remove from heat.
   3. Pluck the bay leaves out of the beans. Stir the onion mixture into the simmering beans.
   4. Turn off the heat, and lightly puree the beans. See the discussion above for safe ways to do this. I like it about 75% pureed, with some significant texture left.
   5. Return to the heat, and taste and adjust for texture and seasoning. It will almost certainly need salt unless you used pre-salted canned beans. You may also find you want more cumin or smoked paprika. Allow to simmer for at least 10-15 minutes for the flavors to develop and marry.
   6. Meanwile, make the salsa. Do this as close to serving time as possible, or at least reserve the cilantro separately, as it dies quickly. Cut the oranges into supremes and combine with the red onion, jalapeno, cilantro, and a healthy pinch of salt. Taste and adjust seasoning.
   7. To serve, ladle the soup into bowls and either garnish with the salsa and some cream, or pass them separately.


Fresh Homemade Soy Milk
-----------------------
Kiss My Spatulaâ€™s version of her childhood soy milk, yields about 5 cups

I buy dried organic soy beans in bulk at our local Island grocery store. 16 oz. sets you back $1.25 or so and produces almost 30 cups of milk!  How can you beat that?  Fresh soy milk can be covered and stored in the fridge for up to 3 days.

Music Pairing:  The Cure, Just Like Heaven

Ingredients

    * 1/2 cup dried organic yellow soy beans
    * 1/8 tsp salt
    * 1/8 cup granulated sugar, plus more to taste

Method

Rinse dried soy beans thoroughly and drain.  Soak in cold water overnight in a large bowl.  Drain again.  Pick through beans and remove those that have not expanded and softened.

Put soybeans and 2 1/2 cups of water in a blender.  Cover lid tightly and puree until smooth and milky.  Transfer the puree to a large stockpot and add 3 additional cups of water.  Bring to a boil over high heat, stirring constantly and skimming off foam, as necessary.  Turn heat to low and simmer, stirring occasionally for 25 minutes.

Strain milk through a fine-mesh sieve lined with cheesecloth into a bowl, pressing on soybeans to squeeze as much liquid out as possible.  Stir in salt and sugar, adding more sugar to taste.  Serve piping hot or ice cold.
