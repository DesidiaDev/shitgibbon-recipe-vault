Brilliant Brown Rice and Lentil Bowl
====================================

Serves 2

Rice and lentils
----------------
1/2 cup brown rice
1/2 cup green lentils rinces

Caramelised onions
------------------
2 medium onions sliced into rings
2tbsp butter or vegetable oil
1 tsp dried chilli flakes
1/2 tsp salt
1 tsp brown sugar

Rice dressing
-------------
Juice of 1/2 lime (1 tbsp or so)
1 tbsp mirin
1/2 tsp sesame sauce
1 tbsp medium or light soy sauce
1 tbsp sweet soy sauce
1 heaped tsp gochujang paste
1/2 tsp salt (this adds the salt that was not in the rice water)

Guacamole
---------
6-8 assorted cherry tomatoes chopped into medium chunks
1 clove garlic finely sliced
1 handful coriander finely chopped
4 small spring onions finely sliced
1 avocado coarsely mashed
Juice of 1/2 lime (1 tbsp or so)
Salt and pepper to taste

Crispy onion sprinkles and some chopped coriander or microgreens

Rice:
Bring 1l of water (do not add salt) to the boil and add the brown rice, bringing the water to a slow simmer. Set a timer for 45 minutes. Add the lentils after 20 minutes and check that the water level remains just above the grains, topping up with boiling water if necessary. Once the rice and the lentils are soft (that timer...), drain thoroughly and set aside.  Note: Salt allegedly prevents lentils from getting soft which is why it is not added to the cooking water.

Caramelised onions:
While the rice is cooking, melt the butter in a heavy based frying pan and add the onions, salt and chilli flakes. Caramelise the onions for 30-40 mins, adding the sugar after 15 mins of cooking. The onions should be soft and golden brown. A few crispy bits are just fine.

Rice dressing:
Mix the ingredients to get a smooth dressing. Once the rice and lentils are done, mix in the dressing. Taste for salt and add if needed.

Guacamole:
Gently mush all the ingredients	to get a coarse guacamole.

Plate:
Heap the rice, caramelized onions and guacamole into two bowls. Sprinkle the crispy onion flakes on the guacamole and a teaspoon of chopped coriander on the rice.
