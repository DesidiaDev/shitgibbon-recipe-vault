Deep fried tofu

It took me ages to figure this out. Choose softer tofu (not the silken stuff) as it gives an amazing texture

Marinade:

50ml light soy sauce
25ml mirin
25ml sweet soy sauce
1 tsp gochujang
2 cloves garlic mashed

300g medium to soft tofu cut into 2-3cm squares. I like them 3cm x 3cm x 1cm
Cornflour

Vegetable oil for deep frying

Mix the marinade ingredients and toss with the tofu cubes and leave to soak for 4h or more. Toss the marinaded tofu cubes in a generous layer of tofu and deep fry the cubes until they are crispy and brown. Drain on kitchen paper and serve with whatever grabs your fancy.
