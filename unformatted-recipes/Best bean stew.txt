Just a great way to eat butter beans. Modified from https://www.lazycatkitchen.com/vegan-bean-stew-spring-veggies/

BEANS
2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil, plus more to serve
Two large onions chopped
8 cloves of garlic peeled and halved lenghtwise
500g butterbeans soaked for 8-12 hrs
2 bay leaves
a few sprigs of thyme or ½ tsp dried
a sprig of rosemary or ½ tsp dried
250 ml / 1 cup white wine or 125ml white wine and 125ml white vermouth
750 ml / 3 cups vegetable stock
salt and pepper
zest 1 unwaxed lemon + juice of ½ lemon, adjust to taste
1-2 tbsp tahini, thinned with a little water first

Heat up olive oil in a heavy bottomed pan. Sauté diced shallots until translucent. Add garlic halves, cut side down and allow them to brown lightly. Add rinsed (soaked) beans, bay leaves, herbs, wine and the stock. Bring to a gentle boil and simmer for about 1-1.5 hours until the beans are soft but not falling apart. Skim the foam off the top at the beginning of the cooking process and top up with more stock when the beans are getting too dry. Cook covered and when the beans are almost done, take the lid off and allow the juices to reduce. Season with salt, pepper, lemon zest and lemon juice to your taste. Stir in the thinned tahini to obtain a rich and creamy sauce.

Serve the beans topped with grilled vegetables such as zucchini, asparagus, snow peas etc. and sprinkle with roasted almonds and crumbled feta cheese.
