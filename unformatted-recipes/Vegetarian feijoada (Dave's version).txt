Runaldo, my epic Brazilian neighbour gave me the base for this recipe. The miso is my not very Brazilian addition but it can easily be substituted with vegetable stock and a big dose of salt.

500g dried black beans
4 bay leaves
1 generous glug of vegetable oil
2 large onions, finely chopped
6 stalks of celery plus leaves, finely chopped
2 large tomato, finely chopped
4 tsp smoked paprika
2 heaped tbsp miso (substitute with a cup of vegetable stock if desired)
4 tbsp tomato paste
2 tsp thyme
4 cloves of garlic finely grated
Big handful of parsley finely chopped
Juice of 2 limes
Salt to taste

Soak the beans in for 8 hours. Put the soaked beans and bay leaves in a pressure cooker in their soaking liquid, ensuring that the beans are covered by 3cm of liquid. Cook for 8 minutes from fully pressurised. Allow the pressure cooker to de-pressurise naturally. Reserve the cooking liquid as there is goodness to be found in it.

Saut√© the onions and celery slowly (sofrito) until they are soft and translucent (about 10 mins). Add the paprika, thyme and half the garlic. Stir for a few minutes before adding the beans and the miso. Smash some beans up in a cup of bean cooking liquid and add this to the mixture to make a succulent stew like texture with enough liquid to soak into the rice later. Simmer for 10 minutes then add the remaining garlic, the parsley and the lime juice. Stir this and garnish with some parsley leaves. Check the seasoning and add salt if needed, noting that miso is pretty salty. Serve with a big pot of fluffy white or brown rice with guacamole, steamed greens and black bean sauce (below).

Serves 6-8 people.
