North African lamb tagine with chickpeas and apricots
Serves 4-6

2 tablespoons olive oil
1 red onion, diced
1 clove garlic, minced
1 red pepper, deseeded and roughly chopped
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon ground coriander
1/2 teaspoon all-spice
1/4 teaspoon dried red chilli flakes
zest of half a lemon, or preserved lemon, if you prefer an intense hit of salty-sour
2 tablespoons harissa paste
1 teaspoon brown sugar
400g left-over, cooked lamb pieces
375ml tomato passata
500ml weak chicken stock
400g tin chickpeas, rinsed and drained
50g Turkish apricots, roughly chopped
a spritz of lemon juice
1/4 teaspoon salt
handful fresh coriander or flat leaf parsley, roughly torn
Greek yoghurt and pomegranate arils, to serve

Saut√© the the onion in the olive oil until soft and slightly caramelised. Add the garlic and red pepper and cook for a further 5 minutes. Now add the cumin, coriander, all-spice, chilli, lemon zest, harissa paste and sugar. Dry fry the spices for a minute or two. This will meld and intensify the flavours. Add the lamb pieces and stir to coat in the spice mix. Add the passata, chicken stock, chickpeas and apricots. Place the lid on and simmer for approximately 40-45 minutes until the sauce is reduced and thickened. Taste and adjust the seasoning if necessary. Freshen the flavours up with a squeeze of lemon juice. Serve with currant and almond bulgur wheat salad and roughly torn coriander or flat leaf parsley, if you prefer. Spoon over some cooling Greek yoghurt and pops of sweet pomegranate arils.
