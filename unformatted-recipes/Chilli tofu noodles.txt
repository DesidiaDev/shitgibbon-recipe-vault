Garlic chilli noodles
Inspired by https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bG8KpOvN5V8&t=368s

6 tbsp cooking oil
150g extra firm tofu
3 tbsp dark soy sauce
5 cloves garlic finely chopped (not crushed)
2 heaped tbsp finely chopped fresh ginger 
1 tbsp gochujang sauce or 1 tsp hot red chilli flakes or powder
2 tbsp oyster sauce
4 spring onions with greens sliced into rings
250g flat oriental noodles (I used home made egg noodles)
 
Bring a medium pot of salted water to the boil for the noodles. Dry the tofu and mash it with a fork. Heat 3 tbsp oil in a pan and add the tofu, stirring frequently until the tofu picks up a little colour (3-4 mins). Add the soy sauce and stir for another minute and set aside. Add the remaining oil to a clean pan and add the garlic and ginger. Saut√© the mixture under a low heat until the garlic is fragrant (2 mins) then add the gochujang/chilli and heat through. Add the noodles to the pot of water and cook according to the instructions on the package (3 mins). While the noodles are cooking, add the tofu to the garlic and chilli mix and stir over a low heat. Drain the noodles and add to the tofu mixture along with the sliced spring onions. Mix thoroughly and divide into two bowls and serve.
