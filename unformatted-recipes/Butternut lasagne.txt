Butternut Lasagne

1.5kg diced butternut/pumpkin
2 tsp brown sugar
20+ fresh sage leaves
2 large onions, finely chopped.
Butter (preferably clarified) for frying sage
100g crumbly Feta style cheese or blue cheese
50g butter
1 tsp nutmeg
Salt and pepper
1.5 l thin white sauce (100g butter, 100g flour, 1.4l of milk)
Lasagne pasta sheets
Grated cheddar cheese for the topping.

Boil the butternut in salted water until soft.

Fry the sage leaves in butter until they are crisp and just browning. Take care not to burn the butter. They should be crispy so crush them finely.

Fry the onion until just browning in a little olive oil. If you like, caramelize them with a little vinegar and sugar.

Mash the butternut and mix in the onion, nutmeg, chopped sage, feta cheese, butter and season to taste with salt and pepper.

Parboil the lasagne sheets

Assemble as you would for a traditional lasagne, alternating thin layers of butternut, white sauce and pasta sheets. Finish with white sauce and a layer of grated cheese. Bake for 40 minutes at 180C.
