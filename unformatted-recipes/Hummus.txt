1 tin chickpeas, drained but reserve the liquid
3 tablespoons of tahini (Spar has the stuff)
10^6 cloves of garlic (ok, 1 is enough for most)
1 level tsp ground cumin
Juice of 1 lemon
50ml good olive oil
Salt and pepper to taste
Optional: 2 ground dried chillies
Olive oil, fresh coriander leaves and smoked paprika

Put the garlic into a food processor or blender for a few moments to chop it
finely. Add the rest of the ingredients as well as a little of the reserved
chickpea liquid. Blend this mixture until smooth, adding the chickpea liquid to
obtain a smooth paste that still retains its shape. Adjust the salt to taste.

Pile the hummus into a serving dish and drizzle your best olive oil around
the dish until it runs deeply and decadently around the edge. Sprinkle liberally
with smoked paprika, Garnish with the coriander leaves or finely sliced spring
onions greens

Consume in any way that spins your windmill.
