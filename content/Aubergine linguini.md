## Ingredients
- 1/2 onion chopped finely
- 1 tsp chilli flakes
- 6-10 anchovy fillets (to taste and also optional)
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 2-3 tbsp butter
- 1 large aubergine cut into 1cm cubes
- 3 cloves garlic finely chopped
- 2 tbsp capers
- 2 ripe medium tomatoes
- 1 tbsp tomato paste
- 2 tsp brown sugar
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 500g good quality linguini or other long pasta

## Directions
1. Saute the onions, chilli and the anchovies (if using) in the oil until they are soft and 
   translucent. The anchovies should dissolve completely in the process. 
1. Add the  butter, garlic and aubergine and fry over a low heat stirring occasionally 
   until the aubergine is soft (10 mins). 
1. Boil the linguini as per the instructions on the packet.
1. Add the capers, tomatoes, tomato paste and brown sugar. Simmer for another 5 to 10 
   minutes and ajdjust the seasoning with salt and pepper.

## Notes
Add more butter if the aubergine absorbs it. Also, the anchovies provide lots of salt so
be cautious before you add more.
