This makes a tasty loaf with a very soft crumb and fine holes. The dough has a 
65% hydration and is best kneaded with damp hands as it is a bit sticky.

## Ingredients
For the poolish:
- 150g rye flour
- 350g white bread flour
- 500g room temperature water
- 4g dried yeast

For the final dough
- 150g rye flour
- 350g white bread flour
- 150g water
- 20g salt
- 6g dried yeast

## Method
1. Prepare the polish by mixing the ingredients until you get a smooth paste. 
   Let the polish ferment for 6-8 hours at room temperaturepr overnight in the fridge
1. Dissolve the salt in the water and combine the water and the remaining ingredients 
   with the poolish and knead until you get an elastic smooth (but sticky) dough (about 10 mins).
1. Put the dough into a large bowl and let it rise for an hour (it must double it's size). 
1. Once it has risen, turn it out dry side down onto a lightly floured surface and divide into
   two 800g loaves. Stretch and shape each loaf and let them rest for a few minutes before 
   putting them unto a pair of well floured 800g oval banneton. 
1. Proove the loaves until the dough just reaches the top of the banneton.
1. Optionally, put the loaves into the fridge overnight for a cold fermentation
1. Turn them out and score deeply lengthwise down the centre.   
1. Bake for 15 minutes at 230°C using steam, then turn the heat down to 190°C bake for a 
   further 25 minutes. 
1. Allow to cool completely on a wire rack before cutting.
   
## Notes   
- Kneading is best done with wet hands and some cussing as the dough is very sticky.
  It soon smoothes out into a manageable elastic dough so just persist. 
- The overnight fermentation adds flavour and has the advantage that you can bake
  the loaves first thing in the morning.
